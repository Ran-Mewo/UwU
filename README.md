# Can I use your code in whatever I am working on?
Yes, you may use my code as long as you give me credits and mention me in a more public place where the public can see that I wrote the code for the part you're going to use. The project was previously licensed under MIT, but many people didn't give me credits or gave the impression to the public that they also wrote the code for whatever code I wrote. All I ask is for credits for the work I did, so the license was switched to LGPL-3 to enforce this more.
